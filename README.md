## Project Goals

The main goal of the project is to build a website with popular mini-games such as "Hangman", "Quiz", "Rock Scissor
Paper" etc.
The entire website and games will be based on the popular Pokemon theme.  

The site is designed to encourage new people to learn about the subject of Pokemon as well as arouse a note of nostalgia
among older fans.

The website and games must be simple and pleasant to use, responsive to mobile devices and compatible with the most
popular web browsers.
